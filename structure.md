# Suggested Project Structure

Root layout (high-level):

- `/docs` — project documentation and design artifacts
- `/backend` — server, API, and database code
- `/frontend` — client application
- `README.md` — project overview and quick start

Each folder should include a README explaining its purpose and setup. The `/docs` folder contains the design and operational docs created below.
